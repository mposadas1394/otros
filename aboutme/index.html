     <p> Hi my name is Matias, I am 28 years old and am from Salta, Argentina <br>
        
         My family is composed by my parents, two siblings and a nephew. I´m the only one that is member of the church and I was baptized at 15.<br>

         I had the opportunity to serve on a mission in Bolivia, La paz some years ago, and the picture that I posted is about that time.<br>

         I´m working as a refrigeration technician but found this area of web development and programming by a friend tht introduced me to this.
         I´ve taken some courses before and realized i love it.
         </p>
